# Kisu's Lounge Minecraft Server 
this is a private repository that contains all the mods we use for our Minecraft servers!

## how to use
1. download the files using zip download when you press the drop code "Code" button
2. copy the mods folder into your game directory's mods folder (if you play on different versions, make sure you're pasting it in the correct version's folder)
3. launch the game with the compatible mods!

## how to join server
please note that since we use e4mc, the server address will be different everytime. (check discord or wherever available)
server will be up at random times, mostly in the afternoon through the night.
